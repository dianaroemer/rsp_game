Agent 007. Greetings. 
How good of you to avail yourself to me.
I'm sure you don't need to me to iterate the usual threats - your terminal has been primed with explosives.
Any attempts at tampering or leaving the terminal for too long will result in your summary death.
More importantly, as I'm certain you'll do that trick you always do and escape at the last moment, I've prepared a few additional explosive elements in critical buildings around the globe. 
I want you dead, Mr. Bond. 
I want to see your meddling come to a swift and decisive finality.
There are those among my organization, however, who would see your entertainments... continue.
*pause*
Let no one say I'm not sporting.
I've had one of my developers create a little game for you.
The rules are simple:
Win, and you'll buy yourself enough time to escape.
Lose, and... Well. I'm sure you understand. 
Best of luck, James.  
I will be watching with the utmost attention.
Let the game.... begin.

On win condition.
Well. A good game, Mr. Bond. A good game indeed.
You have earned a respite from me, Mr. Bond. 
For now.
(Congratulations! You won the game and defeated the villain! If you return to this webpage, press the ~ key to skip the narrative and return to the menu.) 

On lose condition.
A game well played, Mr. Bond. A most compelling conclusion.
Allow me to demonstrate the fruits of your... efforts.
*play explosion images and beethoven's Ode to Job finale*
*clear images*
And now for your own just desserts...
*pause*
One moment.

Ah. It appears the terminal that was destined for you was delivered to a 'Bruce Willis'. 
What a curious name. 
Goodbye, Mr. Bond. We will meet again.
